     * Handle a new block event and synchronize the database state with blockchain.
     *
     * Implementation of this method is approximately as follows:
     * 1) Firstly, we find the latest known block that is synced with the blockchain (by comparing block hashes)
     * and revert all out-of-sync blocks in the reversed order (from the newest to the oldest).
     * 2) Secondly, we process blocks from the last known correct block to the newest block.
     * For stable enough blocks we use batch processing that is faster in some blockchain clients
     * (Ethereum API has batch log requests).
     *
     * Upon returning from this method the database is consistent with the blockchain up to some point,
     * not necessarily up to the [newBlockchainBlock]. It may happen that the chain has been reorganized
     * while this method was syncing forward. The next call of this method will sync the remaining blocks.
